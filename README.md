# 🐍 Python vs. Java ☕  
### *The Ultimate Battle (But Python Already Won! 😆)*  

---

## **1️⃣ Readability & Simplicity 📖**  
Python is designed to be **easy to read** and **simple to write**, while Java... well, let's just say it *loves* boilerplate code.  

### 🔥 **Example: "Hello, World!"**  
#### **In Java:**  
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}




I didn't really have enough time to use markdown, not gonna lie...
